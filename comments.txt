Begin Small, first steps are to get the matrix elements of a Harmonic Wavefunction with a Gaussian. 
We then need to integrate this using Sobol Sequences.

What we have:
Calculate x, f(x) for 0|G(x)|0

What We Need:
Basic calculation of <0|G(x)|0>
Code to Generate any of the Hermite Polynomials,
Code to generate wavefunctions using the Hermite Polynomials
Subroutine to compute matrix elements for any 2 harmonic basis functions.


Current Questions:
Generate any Hermite Polynomial
Generte any Harmonic Basis Function
How do we use sobol numbers to calculate an integral.
