Begin Small, first steps are to get the product between a Gaussian and Hermite Polynomialm (N-Dimensional).
We then need to integrate this using Sobol Sequences.

What We Need:
Code to Generate any of the Hermite Polynomials,
Check to make sure all of the hermite polynomials can be generated
Multiply your polynomial by the 



Matrix Elements (Gaussian*Hermite Polynomial)
Subroutine to compute matrix elements for any 2 harmonic basis functions (and potentials). 


Current Questions:
Generate any Hermite Polynomial
Generte any Harmonic Basis Function
How do we use sobol numbers to calculate an integral.
