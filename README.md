# N-DOF
Fortran-90 implementation of N-dimensional and V wavefunction excitations calculations of Harmonic Oscilator Wavefuntion and associated matrix elements. 
The code utilizes quasi Monte Carlo methods for matrix element calculations, with both Standard Sobol Sequences, and Scrambled Sobol Sequences. 
Matrix Elements Convergence and Eigenvalue Convergence available.
