# N-DOF:
Fortran-90 implementation of N-dimensional Harmonic Oscilator Wavefuntions and associated matrix elements. 
The code utilizes quasi Monte Carlo methods for matrix element calculations, with both Standard Sobol Sequences, and Scrambled Sobol Sequences for a total excitations up to 9. 
Matrix Elements Convergence and Eigenvalue Convergence available.
