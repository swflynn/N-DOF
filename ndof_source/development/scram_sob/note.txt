Start to generalize the code, this script reads in any dimensional scrambled sobol sequence taken from matlab
It is valid for any degree polynomial, and any spatial dimension. 

it reads in your points, makes an array with each coefficient for your polynomials coef(deg,s_dim)
It then makes each polynomial by taking the d_dim points it read in, and calculating all of your polynomials up to degree
Thsi is stored in matrix herm(deg, s_dim). 
Finally matrix A contains the 1D matrix (deg,deg) from 1 to deg products, and does this for each dimension
A(deg,deg,s_dim)

We need to find out how to make our matrix elements now using all of this. 
See tot_perm for restricting how many integrals we will compute
