Keep this directory until I have a working scrambled and non scrambled analysis!

The functions Sandra wrote DO NOT work when I place them within a module
On 5-17-17 Vladimir changed Sandra's code to get them working
I have used the changed code in my module. 

I may need this formulation of the function when I work with the non-scrambled analysis.
