# Working Scripts

### Hermite_Coef
Fortran-90 script to determine the first 10 Hermite Polynomials Coefficients 
Code is adapted from J. -P. Moreau Code see : http://jean-pierre.moreau.pagesperso-orange.fr/Fortran/hermite_f90.txt
Script asks the user what degree polynomial they would like to calculate, and then pronts to screen all of the polynomial coeficients up to that degree. 

### permutations
Fortran-90 script to determine the number of permutations available in a system with a d-dimensional wavefunction and a maximum excitation constraing of Vmax (the total number of excitations in the total wavefunction). 
Input the spatial dimension and maximum excitation, output Jmax, and v(d,Jmax) containing all of the permutations.
