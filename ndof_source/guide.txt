At this level you can find the program MAIN and the associated module within the directory ndof_final.

All of the other directories contain individual portions of the code that were made as I developed the code. 
These directories once working are directly copied into the MAIN module. 

Therefore a specific directory will contain one task from main, with various comments about the development of the code and its functions. 

The ndof_final directory contains the polished working program as a whole. 

The MAIN program is within ndof_final!
