hermite currently calculates teh coefficient for any Hermite polynomial between degree 0-10
(We do not expect to go past dimension 9 for our calculations)

The code outputs a value for each degree of x in subsequent entrees 

Degree is hard coded at the top and selects for which degree you want


Things to do:

We will need to get these as functions of x, therefore we will need to multiply each term by the appropriate power of x

We need to make this something we can call where we choose which polynomial we want (degree)

Need to generate my function for the integral using this
