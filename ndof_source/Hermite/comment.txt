The work in this directory appears in the MAIN program through the SUBROUTINE Hermite_Coeff

hermite calculates the coefficient for any Hermite polynomial between degree 0-10
(We do not expect to go past dimension 9 from the basis scaling calculation)

The code outputs a value for each degree of x in subsequent entrees 

Currently the code asks the user for what degree polynomial they want.


Things to do:

We will need to get these as functions of x, therefore we will need to multiply each term by the appropriate power of x

Need to generate my function for the integral using this
