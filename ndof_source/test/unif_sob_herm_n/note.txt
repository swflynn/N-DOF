This directory uses the sobol.f90 module
It first generates a sequence of uniformly distributed sobol points within 1 array.
It then evaluates each point one by 1 iteratively through the hermite polynomials H_0-H_9
Therefore you just specify how many points to generate, and it will write everything to file data.dat
This code is working fine 3/11/17 -Shane
