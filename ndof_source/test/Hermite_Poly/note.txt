Just as in Expec_fun, I am going to write a function to generate any Hermite polynomial as a function of x.
The goal of this function is to take in any degree Hermite polynomial from 0-10, and to output the evaluation of this polynomial for any value of x. 

The take away from running these calculations and comparing to the calculated value (using mathematica) is that for even small values of x the polynomials 7 and higher do not properly evaluate without changing the percision and formatting abailable to them. 

This problem will need to be addressed, maybe by recursion vlad means calculate degree 0, 1, and then all the others by recursion for each specific x.
