Take any degree Hermite polynomial from 0-10, and to output the evaluation of this polynomial for any value of x. 

The take away from running these calculations and comparing to the calculated value (using mathematica) is that for even small values of x the polynomials 7 and higher do not properly evaluate.

It is numerically unstable to evaluate each degree for a given polynomial, these will need to be calculated using recursion. 

See  unif_sob_herm directory for this method.
