This directory uses the sobol.f90 module
It generates a sequence of uniform distributed sobol points
It then evaluates each point one by 1 iteratively through the hermite polynomials H_0-H_9
The code is written to evaluate a specified number of sobol points, not good for memory, done this way for testing purposes.
This main code will need to be written as a funciton to evaluate a single sobol point, and then loop through the sobol points. 
This code is working fine 3/11/17 -Shane
