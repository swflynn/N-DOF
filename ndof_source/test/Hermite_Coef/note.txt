Code calculates the coefficient for any Hermite polynomial between degree 0-10
(We do not expect to go past dimension 9 from the basis scaling calculation)

The code outputs a value for each degree of x in subsequent entrees 
Currently the code asks the user for what degree polynomial they want.

Usefule for quickly generating the coeficients, this method should not be used for evaluation due to numerical stability of generating the coeficients.
Instead we will write code to use the recursion relation to evaluate each polynomial at a specific point x for H_0-H_9.
