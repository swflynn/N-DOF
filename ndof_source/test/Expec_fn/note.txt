For this integral we are calculating <v|G|v>
Here G is a generic function that we are calculating matrix elements for.
In this case we are going to start with simply using a normalized gaussian
G = G(x) = e^{-(x^2)}

This code uses a function to calculate the value of a normalized gaussian  at point x.
