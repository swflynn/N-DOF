User should set what degree (deg) polynomial they would like to calculate up to
Then set the Nsobol number of points to use and the skip
Code generates a sequence of normally distributed sobol points 'norm' valid for 1 dimension
Then calculates using recursion the HO wavefunction coeficients
The the hermite polynomials are calculated recursively
Finally the matrix elements are calculated by the product of the hermite polynomials and coeficients. 
There is a convergence analysis which writes out each matrix element in a column.
