This code is working properly 3/8/17 -Shane

This code calls the sobol.f90 module to generate a sequence of sobol points that are uniformly distributed. 

You specify your spatial dimension: m
The number of points you want to generate: n
The number of points to skip when generating: seed

And it outputs a vector: r(m,n) containing the points. 
We print the points just to make sure it is working.
