This code is working properly 3/8/17 -Shane

This code calls the sobol.f90 module to generate a sequence of sobol points that are uniformly distributed. 
We then use these point to do a MC integral numerically over a function defined in the program. 

You specify your spatial dimension: m
The number of points you want to generate: n
The number of points to skip when generating: seed

The output is a printed value giving you the integral of interest.
