Here are the various source files for the code I am developing.
Note each directory refers to a specific task I am working on, containing a file with and without comments. 
Once a task is working it is added to the ndof_final directory.
This directory contains the actual working program, with all of the functions and subroutines developed in their individual directories and compiles them inside main. 

Therefore teh actual MAIN program is within ndof_final
