Changed the code to account for mistake with omega.
This made sure we are appropriately calling the potential.
Here are 2 codes, one replaced the difference potential with a harmonoic potential*0.1
This is a small pertebation of hte harmonic, not an actual differenc epotential. 

The other code is the full difference potential (quasi_nm.f90).
