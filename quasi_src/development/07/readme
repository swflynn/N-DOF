Current version of the workng code (10/16/17)

This code is for a single water molecule (basis = 9). 
This code uses the new permutation method which sets certain basis elements to 0. 
The input requires a list with this specified. 

Code using quasi-MC (ssobol.f) to compute difference potential. 

At convergence evaluations and print out we compute the kronicker delta matrix and add its terms to the diagonal elements. 
We then compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.

Lookig forward we need code to determine the excitations of interest and compute their energy
