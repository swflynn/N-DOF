First draft uding dgb to compute monomer
I am in the process of converting to subdimension calculations. 

Currently there are some issues with the overlap matrix not being positive definite
This is probably a result of an incorrect equation (most likely the alpha(r) calcaulations which had a problem in 2D toy model as well.

This code is before I started doing the subspace calculations and optiminzing the code
