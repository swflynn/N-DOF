11-9-18 ==> Code seems to be working for 1D calculations
moving on to 2D case, if we confirm there we will move on and place this into scripts

Code uses constant alpha parameter and uniform grid definede in the input file
Also uses regularization to improve ill-conditioning of the overlap matrix
Use new derivations (in terms of normal mode coordinates) to define the code
