QDGB Implementation

User provides an input geometry (xyz) the number of Gaussians, the Gaussian widths, and the number of integration points for computing the Hamiltonian Matrix and associated eigenvalues. 
A quasi-random grid for integration is generated using the ground state wavefunctions distribution, and quasi-monte carlo methods are used for computing the potential energy matrix numerically.
