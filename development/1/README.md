# Current Developments
The current version of the code computes fundamental frequencies for a single water molecule within a water cluster.
We need to analyze every monomer within the cluster, and would like to run each analysis indepedently. 
Currently writing a bash script to interchange the molecules within the input xyz file and execute each calculation. 

Also will need to automate the data analysis portion of the project.
